Mr. Garrison's classroom. Red and Clyde are the last ones to take their seats.
Kyle
Hey, Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
Stan
Yeah, it was huge.
Cartman
Ugh, I hate those things.
Kyle
Nobody hates rainbows.
Stan
Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
Cartman
Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like, "Hey! Get outta my ass, you stupid rainbows!" [Silence.]
Stan
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
Cartman
I'm talking about rainbows! I hate those friggin' things!
Kyle
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Cartman
Oh, rainbows. Oh, yeah, I like those, those are cool.
Stan
What were you talking about?
Cartman
Huh? Oh, nothing. Forget it.
Kyle
No. What marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Cartman
Nothing. Nothing!
Mr. Garrison
Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month? [Silence. Everyone in the class gives a blank stare. Cartman is also looking sideways.] One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.
The whole class gasps in surprise.
Wendy
[Softly.] Wow, I knew I would win!
Mr. Hat
Gosh, Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.
Mr. Garrison
That's right, Mr. Hat. [Proceeds with the winner announcement.] The winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman.
Wendy
[Shocked.] What?
Cartman
What?
Mr. Garrison
Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.
Cartman
Kick ass!
Stan
That's impossible! Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart.
Cartman
[Defending himself.] Yeah, I do! Pop-Tarts are frosted!
Mr. Garrison
Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.
Kyle
Wow. What did you write about, Cartman?
Cartman
Oh, you know, this and that.
Wendy
He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
Kyle
[Curious.] What was your paper about, Wendy?
Wendy
My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins.
Cartman
'ere, y'see? You shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
Stan
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Cartman
Buh, ah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?
Wendy
[Shocked once again.] What?
Mr. Garrison
Wait, wait, there's more. [Continues reading the message.] It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by... [Gasps softly, gets shocked] Kathie Lee Gifford?
Kyle
Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?!
Mr. Garrison
And the presentation will be on national television.
Stan, Kyle
[The camera zooms at both of them.] Television?
Mr. Garrison
[Thinking to himself.] Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.
City Hall. Mayor's Office.
Mayor McDaniels
[With verve.] Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! [Looking through the window.] This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
Ted
Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.
Johnson
Maybe even a State Senator.
Ted
Mayor, we should decorate the town square.
Johnson
Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song and play up the ethnic diversity of our town.
Mayor McDaniels
That's right! He's a black guy, isn't he?
Ted
Black as the night itself, Mayor.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
Ted
If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.
Johnson
Ohh.
Ted
Ouch. [Johnson laughs.] Thank you.
South Park Elementary Cafeteria.
Cartman
You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.
Wendy
[Passing by.] Hitler was famous too...
Chef
[Stopping by.] Hello there, children.
Kyle, Stan
Hey, Chef.
Chef
How are my little crackers today?
Kyle, Stan
Good.
Chef
Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
Stan
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Cartman
[Off-screen] Hey!
Chef
Yeah, yeah, oh, whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony!
Kyle
Wow! Are you gonna do it?
Chef
Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
Stan
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Kenny
(How big's your penis, Chef?)
Chef
Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway.
He giggles, somewhat embarrassed.
Mr. Garrison's Classroom. Garrison is at his desk and Mr. Hat is across from him in a chair.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.
Notices Mr. Hat.
Mr. Garrison
Why are you looking at me like that, Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
[Now on Mr. Garrison's hand.] Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?
Mr. Garrison
Mmm-mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child.
Mr. Hat
We could have won that talent show. We could have been huge.
Flashback to the National Talents Show Finals.
Lil Mr. Garrison
Knock-knock, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
Who's there?
Lil Mr. Garrison
Orange.
Mr. Hat
Orange who?
Lil Mr. Garrison
Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
The audience seems to be not impressed. Only one person claps.
Mr. Hat
Thank you.
Judges show scores of 8.9, 9, 7.8 and 9.2 with slightly blank expressions on their faces.
Lil Mr. Garrison
[Backstage.] Wow, Mr. Hat, looks like we might win.
Show Announcer
And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein. [She comes to the stage with a huge smile as her appearance is announced.]
Lil Kathie Lee
If they could see me now, that little gang of mine.
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine.
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer first-rate chums I attract
[Mexican puppet] All I can say is, "Wow-wee, look-a where I am."
[Tourist puppet] Tonight I landed, Pow!, right in a pot of jam.
What a setup! Holy Cow!
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now!

Crowd goes wild. Judges show all 10's. Little Garrison is shocked.
In the present.
Mr. Garrison
It wasn't fair—she had choreography. How could we compete with that?
Mr. Hat
But now she's coming to South Park and I know a way to make it all better.
Mr. Garrison
How?
Mr. Hat whispers to Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
[Gasps.] No, Mr. Hat! I couldn't... kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
Mr. Garrison's Classroom, later in the day. The Mayor is now there.
Mayor McDaniels
Children, as you all know, Ms. Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.
Cartman
[Gets angry.] That kid is me!
Mayor McDaniels
Whatever. [She continues.] Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.
Mr. Garrison
That'll be wonderful, won't it, Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
[In a demonic voice after being held up by Mr. Garrison.] Kill her!
Mr. Garrison
[Shushes him down.] Mr. Hat!
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, that's perfect! You see, Mr. Hat? We don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.
Wendy
Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.
Mayor McDaniels
Who cares? Now, kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!
The whole class is silent. Only Annie is smiling.
Mayor McDaniels
And who's our little prize winner again?
Cartman
[Irritated.] Me! Eric Cartman!
Mayor McDaniels
How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras, don't we?
Cartman
Yes, ma'am! [Sings.]
I'm gonna be on television
I'm gonna be on television

Bus Stop. The kids have gotten off the bus and are going home.
Cartman
[Grunts, then continues to sing.]
I'm gonna be on television
I'm gonna be on television

Stan
[Gets mad at Cartman and turns around to face him.] We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
Cartman
Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
Stan
Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly!
Cartman
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
Stan
Dolphins are way smarter than you!
Cartman
If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?
Stan
Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!
Cartman
Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree-hugging hippie crap!
Stan
[Desperately.] Tell me what you wrote about!
Cartman
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape! [Walks away.]
Stan
Yeah, right. You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!
Cartman
[Off-screen.] Screw you, hippie!
Cartman's house. He's doing exactly what Stan predicted: sitting on the couch in front of the TV and eating Cheesy Poofs.
TV Announcer
We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals after this.
Beefcake
Hey! You need to get in shape fast?! [Cartman tilts his head.] Wanna look your best?! Tired of the other guys getting all the chicks?! Are you tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!
Cartman
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.
Beefcake
Then bulk up quick [His hand which holds the product goes through the screen] with Weight Gain 4000!
Cartman
Yes!
Beefcake
With over 4,000 grams of saturated fat per serving, its patented formula is designed to enter the mouth, and go directly to the stomach where it is distributed to the bloodstream. [Now holding two cans of Weight Gain 4000.] Now available in stores everywhere. Get some today and say with me, "Beefcake"!
Cartman
Beefcake.
Beefcake
Beefcake!
Cartman
Beefcake!
Beefcake
Beefcake!
Beefcake, Cartman
[In unison] Beefcake!
TV Announcer
[While the warning shows up on screen.] May cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver.
Cartman
[Asks Liane.] Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?
Liane
[Shows up with a signature cookie plate.] Okay, Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow.
Cartman
But m-ae-m, I need it for tomorrow!
Liane
But tomorrow is grocery day, Eric.
Cartman
[Shrieking and begging.] Mm-mo-om! Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousand! I need it!
Liane
Okay, okay. Well, I.. [leaves the house] guess I'll be going to the store now then.
Cartman smiles broadly.
Mr. Garrison's bed. He hears Kathie Lee Gifford singing the first few lines of her National Talent Show song she performed in the past. He wakes up startled.
Mr. Garrison
No, no! [Starts to sweat.]
Mr. Hat
[Laying on the chair, in a demonic voice.] Kill her.
Mr. Garrison
No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it!
Mr. Hat's head starts spinning slowly, demonically, his pupils glow red.
Mr. Hat
Kill! [Mr. Garrison grabs him right away.]
Mr. Garrison
That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat. [Puts him in the top drawer and closes it.]
Mr. Hat
[Inside the drawer.] She'll make a fool of you again!
Mr. Garrison
Well, you can just stay in that drawer, Negative Nancy.
Bus Stop, next morning.
Cartman is a bit bigger and showing it off by wearing a Beefcake muscle shirt instead of layers of clothes he's usually wearing. He's also holding a can of Weight Gain 4000.
Cartman
Hey, dudes.
Kyle
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
Cartman
Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
Stan
What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
Cartman
I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
Kenny
(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen.)
Kyle
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's.
Kyle, Stan and Kenny laugh together.
Cartman
Laugh all you want! I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff.
He chugs the can of Weight Gain.
Stan
[Off-screen.] What's that stuff?
Cartman
Weight Gain 4000—it's helping me bulk up.
Kyle
Bulk up to what, fat ass?
Stan
Super fat ass?
Cartman
Ayy! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
The bus arrives and the others go in ahead of him. Cartman struggles to get in as a result of constant drinking of Weight Gain.
Cartman
Eh, eh. Sweet. [Kyle looks at him.] Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.
Town Square. A flag with 'Welcome Kathie Lee' written in uppercase goes up.
Mayor McDaniels
Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!
Cows
[Out in a pasture, mooing in confusion]
Outdoor stage. The class has moved there to practice a play.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?
Mr. Garrison
Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage...
Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kevin Stoley go.
Mr. Garrison
Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage.
Pip, Kenny, Red, and Tolkien go.
Clyde Donovan
[Seen from Mr. Garrison's perspective.] Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?
Mr. Garrison
[Seen from Clyde's perspective.] Do you have a feather on your head?
Clyde
Yes.
Mr. Garrison
Then you're an Indian.
Clyde
Oh.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, Bebe, this is your line.
Bebe Stevens
[Haltingly.] This is the story... of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
The curtains part to reveal Clyde, Tolkien, Pip, Red, and Kenny, all dressed like Indians, sitting in a circle beneath a prop teepee.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, don't they look adorable?
Bebe
Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers.
Pioneers come on stage and start beating the Indians and tossing them about. Screams and cries are everywhere, a tee-pee falls in front of Kenny.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, my God!
Mr. Garrison
They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.
Bebe
The pioneers met with the Indians and negotiated for their fertile lands.
Kevin the Indian lands by her, with blood oozing out of a gash on his head. She steps aside. Pioneer Butters punches Indian Pip repeatedly.
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison! We can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford!
Mr. Garrison
Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.
Stan
Take that, you stupid Indian!
Stan beats Clyde the Indian with the butt of his gun.
Clyde
Dow!
Mayor McDaniels
[Furious.] Mr. Garrison! This is not appropriate! Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!
Mr. Garrison
[Also furious.] To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!
All stop and gasp in shock after hearing Mr. Garrison's words.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, my God, what have I said?
Townsman
He said, "To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"
Boos all around.
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play.
Mr. Garrison skulks away.
Back at Mr. Garrison's House...
Mr. Hat
[After the drawer being opened, in his deep voice.] It happened again, didn't it? Now we do things my way.
Mr. Garrison
I can't kill her, Mr. Hat. You're gonna have to do it.
Mr. Hat laughs diabolically.
Town Square Stage. The sun rises, everyone is gathering to prepare for Kathie Lee's appearance. A sign counting down the days to the big day is shown on the screen.
Kyle
Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.
Cartman is much bigger now. He's holding another can of Weight Gain 4000.
Cartman
Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
Kyle
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
Cartman
[Defending himself.] I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
Kyle
[Angry.] Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go, "God... damn it, that's a big, fat ass!"
Cartman
No, they don't, you jealous weakling!
Townsman
[Surprised, saying the exact same words as Kyle.] God damn, that's a big fat ass!
Cartman
Ayy!
Wendy
[Walks up to the stage.] Hi, guys.
Cartman
Oh, look, another hippie.
Cartman gives her the peace sign.
Cartman
Peace, Wendy.
Stan
[While pointing at him.] Shut up, Cartman!
Cartman
Oh-oh!
Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree

Wendy moves by Cartman and then whispers to Stan.
Wendy
I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.
Cartman
K-I-S-S-I-N-G! First comes the baby and...

Jimbo's Guns. There is a poster welcoming Kathie Lee on the left side of the store entrance.
Jimbo Kern
Can I help you?
Mr. Garrison
Yes. I need a gun.
Jimbo
Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?
Mr. Garrison
Other.
Jimbo
Alrighty, then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!
Hands Mr. Garrison a gun.
Jimbo
That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
Mr. Garrison
[Talking to the mirror.] You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] I don't know, it's a little small.
Jimbo
Okay, how about this? [Gives him a bigger gun.]
Mr. Garrison
[Talking to the mirror, again.] You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.
Jimbo
Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.
Mr. Garrison
[Talking to the mirror for the last time.] You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me. [To Jimbo after the camera zooms on his fiery face.] I'll take it.
Mr. Garrison's Classroom, lights out. Wendy enters.
Wendy
Hello?
She sneaks over to file cabinet. Sees her paper first and is disgusted to find Cartman's question in writing: "If dolphins are so smart, why do they live in igloos?", which is written in red. Wendy gets furious because of this. Then she finds his paper and reads it.
Wendy
My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."
Mr. Garrison enters the classroom. Wendy hides to not get caught.
Mr. Garrison
Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think [Holds up a gun and aims it at the screen] we owe her for that. Buh-bang!
Wendy
[Gasps.] Oh my God.
Town Square. It's official—Kathie Lee Gifford is arriving today as the countdown sign is finally changed. The recording equipment is slowly prepared. Mr. Garrison walks down the street with his rifle as if it's normal.
Townsman
Howdy, Mr. Garrison, nice gun.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you.
Townswoman
[In a thick accent.] Nice gun, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Thanks.
He approaches Officer Barbrady.
Mr. Garrison
Hello, Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
Nice gun!
Mr. Garrison
Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot— uh—, view of Kathie Lee?
Officer Barbrady
Hmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.
They both look up at it. Two vultures fly around it.
Mr. Garrison
[Softly.] Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you, Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
No problem.
He turns to a fan walking by with a camera and grabs it as fast as possible.
Officer Barbrady
Ha! Caught you red handed! No pictures of Kathie Lee!
Mayor McDaniels
[On stage, nervous.] Where is she?
Cartman, off stage, looming over his friends now. He looks even bigger than before.
Cartman
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake, beefcake!
Kyle
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame, Cartman.
Wendy
[Rushing in, very concerned.] You guys, we have to stop him!
Kyle
Stop who?
Wendy
Mr. Garrison! He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford!
Cartman
Oh, no, you don't! You're not going to ruin my moment of fame!
Wendy
He's got a gun!
Cartman
You got to get over this whole jealousy thing, a'ight? Seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.
Wendy
It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!
Stan
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Wendy
[Sweetly.] Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?
Stan falters and looks down, unable to resist her.
Kyle
Uh-oh, we're losing him.
Cartman looks down at Stan.
Mayor McDaniels
[On the microphone, excited] Here she comes!
The band starts playing. Kathie Lee comes in riding in bulletproof 'bubble' on the back of a truck.
Mr. Garrison is looking on from the book depository window with a gun.
Mr. Garrison
Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.
Townswoman
We love you, Kathie Lee! [Chuckles.]
Kathie Lee Gifford
I love you, too.
Mr. Garrison
Come on, you little b****. [Takes aim.] You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy.
Mayor McDaniels
[On stage.] It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
Crowd cheers.
Mayor McDaniels
And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford. [The camera focuses on Kathie Lee looking endearingly at what's going to happen.]
Chef
[On stage.] Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You know, Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. No, no, no, no, no. I mean "special". Like the song of, uh, the hummingbird as it gets ready to.. find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and—, and groaning and—, and [The band starts playing the song Chef has prepared] letting their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy. [Starts to sing.]
Oh, Kathie Lee
How I'd love to lay you down
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue

Mayor McDaniels
[Shocked after hearing the lyrics.] What?! [Kathie Lee feels shook as well.]
Chef
Kathie Lee
You're my sexual fantasy

Mayor McDaniels
What? Oh, God!
Chef
How 'bout you and me

Quickly taking the mic from him.
Mayor McDaniels
Uh, thank you, Chef for that heartwarming song.
Chef
Get together and make... sweet... love?

Mayor McDaniels
Thank you, Chef!
She grabs the mike and drags him off.
Chef
Oh, oh. God bless you, Kathie Lee! [Blows a kiss as he's dragged by McDaniels.]
Wendy
[Wendy and Stan run up, feeling very nervous.] Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!
Officer Barbrady
What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. [Flashes back.]
Mr. Garrison
Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot— uh—, view of Kathie Lee?
Officer Barbrady
Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet. I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository—
His face gets bigger with every repetition of the word "depository". He snaps to.
Officer Barbrady
Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB! [Walks away.]
Stan
Wendy, look!
Stan points to the book depository, where Mr. Garrison is still trying to aim at Kathie Lee.
Back on stage.
Mayor McDaniels
And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own Eric Kauffman...
Cartman
[Off-screen, getting mad and correcting Mayor McDaniels.] Cartman, God damn it.
Mayor McDaniels
...is your favorite celebrity, and mine... [Crowd cheers.] Kathie Lee Gifford!
Kathie Lee is thrust up on stage in her bubble by her security force. Cartman's mom hugs her heart, feeling joyful.
Kathie Lee
Thank you. I love you all.
Stan and Wendy reach the Book Depository and try to stop Mr. Garrison from causing chaos.
Stan
Mr. Garrison, stop!
Mr. Garrison
Leave us. We must finish what we have begun!
Wendy
I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
Mr. Garrison
You can't know.
Wendy
[Feeling bad for Mr. Garrison.] You should have won that talent show.
We're back on the stage. Kathie Lee is ready to give Cartman his award.
Kathie Lee
It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?
Cartman
[Dreamingly, while being pushed by Kyle and Kenny.] Here it is, my big moment of fame.
Book Depository.
Mr. Garrison
[Finishing his story about losing to Kathie Lee at the talent show.] ...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
Wendy
I know that, Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.
Mr. Garrison
It is... too late for me, young Wendy.
Cartman finally gets on the stage, while Mr. Garrison takes aim.
Wendy
You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.
Lowering his weapon.
Mr. Garrison
You... you're right.
Wendy
Good...
Stan
[Accidentally provoking Mr. Garrison.] Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
Mr. Hat
[Snapping into position.] The b**** must die!
Mr. Garrison tries his best to fight back. Out of the sudden, Cartman's weight breaks the stage.
Kathie Lee
[Muffled shrieking]
She flies through the air. Mr. Garrison fires at her, thinking she is still on stage, however Kenny is ended up being shot.
Kenny
(Oh, no!)
He flies through the air and is impaled through the head by a flag pole. He slides on down and leaves the flag covered in blood.
Kyle
[Gasps.] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Kathie Lee's bubble lands on the truck.
Agent 1
Gun!
Agent 2
Gun!
Kyle
Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play.
The entourage drives off and the crowd groans in disappointment.
TV Crew Director
I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up.
Cartman
Hey, wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
TV Crew Director
Forget it, kid. No Kathie Lee: no public interest.
Cartman
[Whining.] But I won the environmental essay contest!
Wendy
[Comes on the broken stage.] You don't deserve to win, Cartman. And you know it.
Into mic.
Wendy
I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out and Cartman's name written in its place.
Townsman 1
Who cares?
Townsman 2
Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.
Stan
What about.. not holding anything against the person who wins?
Wendy
Well, not if it's Cartman.
Into mic.
Wendy
[The crowd begins to leave.] Hey, where are you all going!
Aside.
Wendy
They don't even know what Walden is.
Into mic.
Wendy
I bet if Walden was a sitcom, you'd all know what it was!
Stan
Come on, Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches. [Leaves the stage.]
Wendy
Ah, what the hell.
Kids walk out.
Mayor McDaniels
[Crying.] No, no! Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever with all these stupid hick, r******, jobless, truck driving idiots!
Ted
Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.

Obesity. Adiposity. Corpulence. Whatever word you use, it represents one thing—being a big fat ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house.
