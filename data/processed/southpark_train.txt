CARTMAN: The college know-it all hippies.
KYLE: Wha whataya mean?
CHEF: We [a struggle is heard in the hall and the council members turn to see what it is. The door opens and Cartman rushes in, roughed up]
CARTMAN: It's it's simple science. Look When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that lasts for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. [the adults don't get it, Cartman sighs heavily]
DRIVER: Well so my idea was this Let's have, like, a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down. [foam appears out of nowhere and covers the hippie driver] Whoa, what the hell?! [Cartman appears]
CARTMAN: Everybody get in a single file line!
OFFICER_BARBRADY: I was just over at your house and freed sixty three people you had locked in your basement.
RANDY: Sta ogh. Ugh! [he falls to the ground gagging, then gets into a fetal position and passes out]
CARTMAN: Let me guess they've started a hippie jam band music festival.


STAN: Ah all right just let me get this straight the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
CPT.: Gabriel Look at that no lights on, nothing. It's like, humans have never been to this part of Peru. [the camera zooms out and at least eight giant burrowing holes appear before them.]
SOLDIER: Uh, Machu Picchu, sir?

RANDY: The spirit of middle class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellow Creek. Now go. GO! [Stan steps away, then runs. Randy relaxes and lays down]


ANNIE: She's super rich!
RED: Hey check it out the new Paris Hilton perfume, Skanque. [grins and holds a heart-shaped bottle with the name on it]
RED: It's not just Paris Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're all stupid spoiled whores!
BUTTERS: Wa I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh, even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."

LINDA: The rest of the f you do mean us?
WENDY: I'm a stupid spoiled whore. her dress is relaxed blue jeans and turquoise tank top with one strap over the right shoulder. The girls laugh at her reply]
ANNIE: Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three way. [Tweek and Jason walk by]
ANNIE: Be at Bebe's house tonight at 7 00! [Cartman clears his throat, closes his locker, and walks past the girls. Not one of them says a thing.]
CHRIS: All right Butters tell you what if you can raise the $250,000,000 yourself, you can stay.
BUTTERS: Y yes sir! [rushes out of the room] I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!

SOUTH: Park's Whore off. A gazebo is set up for the event in South Park Square. A crowd gathers.
MR.: Slave makes his move he gets off his chair and walks over to Paris, then moves her around till he's satisfied she's where he wants her to be. The crowd falls silent and Mr. Slave walks back to his chair.
CHRIS: So so that's it? No $200,000,000? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!

BIKER: 5 hey, nobody here is really paying attention to us.
BIKER: 7 Thah that little boy just called us fags.
BIKER: 2 Did that kid just call us ?
LEAD: Biker Ju just ignore him! [as they ride, a car pulls up in front of them. Two kids in the back seat turn and make gestures to them. One of the boys makes a sign, then turns it around. Both kids hold it up. It says "FAGS." One of them mouths the word and the boys laugh.] God damn it, this is fucked up!
CARTMAN: Ni nice, okay.
KYLE: W well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of our town.

LEAD: Biker Well I think that I think that you uh, you probably won't say it again.

I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.

DAMLA: Mmm I don't know. [looks away and down]
BUTTERS: We ell hold on a second, you guys.
BUTTERS: ...So I told you guys before [with emphasis] I'm not Kenny.
STAN: All right the original AVID cut of Star Wars Episode I
CARTMAN: Buh ters! Buh-ters!
MAN: with foot on head The talk show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one.
ANNOUNCER: Next on the Maury Povich show we bring back some of our favorite disfigured people [four scenes: first, the man with the foot on his head is talking to the girl with rapid aging disease and disfigured country singer, then the disfigured country singer is shown eating a subway sub, then the man with no face shows his disfigurement, and finally Butters' shadow is shown in profile] and introduce you to some new ones.
CARTMAN: Did he say "the... largest putt putt golf course in the world"?
OPERATOR: Please help my out-of control child.
STAN: I told them where to find you.
BUTTERS: For havin' balls on my AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'. [strikes the pose again] Ah I'm not grounded.
ANNOUNCER: Today on Maury Povich These moms [three are shown. Only Liane grins] don't know what to do with their out-of-control kids! [a fat blonde girl is shown, then Cartman's school picture] Young boys and girls so whorish on our show that it borders on child pornography!
CARTMAN: What evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
CARTMAN: I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What evah! I'll do what I waunt!
MAURY: Let's bring her out here's Chantal! [Chantal crawls out amid audience boos. The camera focuses on her diaper. Chantal reaches Joline, who picks her up and sits her on the chair next to hers] So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men? [Chantal plays with her rattle]
JOLINE: Maurih it's like this Whenever I have friends over to the house Chantal will come waltzin' in the livin' room completely naked!
VANITY: Whatevah. I helped in a drive by shooting.
CARTMAN: What evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
ELEPHANT: man A lot of decent hard working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of ours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with "freak" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, "Look for the True Freak label" [his image fades to that of the True Freak label]


MONTAGE: Cartman tries out his suit in front of a full-length mirror in his room. Stan and Kyle try out suits in Kyle's room. Next, the boys are in a department store purchasing cell phones at Bull's Eye. Next, Stan and Kyle carry an executive desk into the new office. Next, Cartman and Kenny steal a fountain from somebody's backyard. Next, flyers for the new agency, Super Awesome Talent Agency, are printed out. Next, the boys are at a copy center to get some business cards. Next, Cartman and Kyle set up signs around town. Next, the finished office is shown... in Cartman's basement. The four boys congratulate each other for a job well done.
CARTMAN: Wait a minute You guys this is very important when I bring Tolkien back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
TOLKIEN: I'm supposed to be home by 3 30.
CARTMAN'S: basement er, Super Awesome Talent Agency. Cartman takes Tolkien down the stairs and onto the agency floor
CARTMAN: Now Tolkien I I know what you're saying to yourself You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them 10%?" Right?
KYLE: Ahh d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
PRODUCER: Be at this address tomorrow 2 00 PM sharp. And don't be late.
CARTMAN: Who let ?


MY: paper was on the suffering of bottle nose dolphins.
IF: they're working in a sweat shop that is.
MMM: mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child.
KNOCK: knock, Mr. Hat.
IT: wasn't fair she had choreography. How could we compete with that?
CARTMAN'S: house. He's doing exactly what Stan predicted sitting on the couch in front of the TV and eating Cheesy Poofs.
BUT: m-ae m, I need it for tomorrow!
WEIGHT: Gain 4000 it's helping me bulk up.
K-I-S-S-I-N: G! First comes the baby and...
MY: essay by Eric Cartman "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."
TOWN: Square. It's official Kathie Lee Gifford is arriving today as the countdown sign is finally changed. The recording equipment is slowly prepared. Mr. Garrison walks down the street with his rifle as if it's normal.
FORGET: it kid. No Kathie Lee no public interest.


CARTMAN: Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
CARTMAN: Kyle it says right there Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
CARTMAN: We're a non profit company, Kyle.
CARTMAN: It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
KYLE: Here's the thing Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies. [Stan just blinks, still half-awake. Kyle turns and looks at him] Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
CRAIG: Slash isn't real. He's a made up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.
BUTTERS: Slash is make believe??
KYLE: You don't think that ? But he isn't real.


BUTTERS: Wo ah I'm getting steamed now. [follows the other three. The phone remains on the floor]
CARTMAN: A AIDS?
JARED: Y you think so. Well, why... should it matter?
CARTMAN: Oh-my god! [turns around] You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
KYLE: Tha that's diarrhea.
CARTMAN: Weh who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
STAN: You wouldn't be a penis butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight...
KYLE: Twenty two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
BUTTERS: Wull I can't eat no more. I I just keep pukin' it up.
JARED: Thank hoo, thank you all. Subway is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight!
JARED: Having aides - is awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible! [the rep, looking on in dismay, has had enough and pushes Jared out of the way to take the mic]
BUTTERS: W well, k-kinda like Cartman. [Cartman slaps Butters and shakes him] Aw!
CARTMAN: I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
BUTTERS: go where?
BUTTERS: No but you don't sound like me.
JARED: Yes. ...Y you mean you all thought...? Oh my Gosh!
SKEETER: Aha [stops and realizes something] ...Hey. We're all laughing. [everyone stops and listens]
BUTTERS: Hu oh! Goody!
BUTTERS: perfect.


GENERAL: Deckter Quick boys how does the Imagination Song go?

BEBE: Uh. Listen guys um it's 5 30. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. [leaves. The boys continue grunting and putting on displays. She walks faster the farther she moves from the boys. The boys notice her absence and stop.]

WENDY: But then the mall closes at 4 00 or 5:00, so who knows w-
BEBE: ...You guys still wanna go ice skating after school?

RANDY: Bohh riiing.
RANDY: I know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! [walks away thwarted and goes to his den. He picks up a cordless phone on the way. He leaves the lights off in there and walks to his desk, dialing a number. He sits down as his call is answered]
AMANDA: I'm making a pan roasted chicken.

ALCOHOLICS: Anonymous meeting. A 12 step program is on the wall behind the speaker.

Polar bears... polar-- polarity! I can switch the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to! [turns around and types away on the console. The power cuts out and the center goes dark.] What the heck? [the sound of heavy ships is heard, and two bright beams light up the room. Everyone looks towards a window. Outside, a visitor walks up and looks in through one end window. A second one looks through the other end window. The windows shatter] They're coming in! [a glow appears outside a door and permeates it. The door shuts and two visitors enter. The other two come in through the window and the four of them converge on the boys, Chef, and Jeff.]
ALIEN: Dy-no mite!
JEFF: When I reversed the polarities I found this [sits at the console and starts pressing keys. 1s and 0s flash across a screen] It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says.
STAN: Our planet is just a reality TV show?
JOOZIAN: 1 He all right, all right Earthlings! Ya, you win! The show can stay on.

CARTMAN: Whatever. The whole class scored super high on the test.
CLASS: "I mis interpreted the rules."
CLASS: "I mis interpreted the rules."
CLASS: "I mis interpreted the rules."

BILL: Owens Then I would have something to fall back on. So something to take all the pressure off of me.
MRS.: Garrison Let's see what happens when we put two same sex couples together to take care of an egg, shall we?! Kyle, you are now with Stan! And Wendy is with Bebe! [Kyle and Wendy exchange glances]

MRS.: Garrison You have to get an A Eric. Here I'll sign this new egg for you. We'll pretend this never happened, all right? [goes about making a duplicate egg for Cartman] Just... put on the old hair, color in the same eyes... There we go, good as new.

NEWS: stand night. The headline on today's South Park Herald "Who Is Mysterion?" The camera pulls back to reveal Mysterion looking around and running down the sidewalk across the street.
PROFESSOR: Chaos O oh careful General Disarray.

LIANE: Oh ye yes, of course,sweetie.

CARTMAN: D don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.


ALRIGHT: alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3 4. [again, the march and play. Cartman gets carried away and the others glare at him]
NOW: remember everybody for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. [continues as the boys speak]
"TAMARACK: Hill " 9 00 A.M. The Reenactment. Bleachers flank Grandpa on either side as the North and the South face off before him. Each side has set up its camp

TOPEKA: Kansas 7 53 A.M., next morning. A rooster crows. The town goes about its business. A mailman delivers some mail. A woman opens the school door. A traffic cop directs traffic. Two kids play catch in front of the school. The woman returns with the flag and hoists it up on the flagpole, and the mailman drops by.
I'M: afraid I was grading papers pretty late and [both turn in the direction of a rumble. Everyone stops and looks in the same direction]
UH-UH: uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store.

YEE: haw! All right!
WASHINGTON: D.C. 7 45 A.M., next day. The group has entered the city and are protesting outside the white house. The Million Confederate March?
AS: Vice Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: [the camera zooms out for a view of the city, then the planet, then the Milky Way, then the binary-star system of Marklar, the Marklar themselves, then another planet, then the Visitors are seen...] -AAAH!!!


JIMMY: Duh n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay.
JIMMY: What- what am I supposed to s say?
ANCHOR: Shock and disbelief tonight as the German engineered Funnybot delivered his opening lines at the Hollywood Forum, then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred, killing nearly all of them. Spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated, irrational, and also, pretty Goddamned funny, solidifying the opinion once agan that Funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time.
JIMMY: Wuh w what?!
FUNNYBOT: That is my purpose to be ultimate comedian.
JIMMY: It's a- v validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
JIMMY: Don't worry fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!


I'LL: tell you why it has to be you Kenny because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us. [tugs on Kenny's hood] "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.
YYEP.: Oo one of mine came out not two hours ago.
HA-A: ugh.
HU: aah!
OH.: Eh hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.
O: oh, thank you. Freebie next week. [hangs up]
TIH: [the tooth he placed under his pillow is still there] Tooth? [picks it up and looks at it in disbelief] What the hell? Mom!
YI: you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
HOW: could ? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
WE: can take the bus to the city. There's super rich people down there!
WHAT: the ? [the camera peels back to show another group of kids on the other side of the bush]
LET: me ask you something You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?
BEAT: up boy
TELL: you what how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?
OH.: I don't know.
FELLOW: dentists As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this. [presses a button to reveal a projection] A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel [shown sitting on a tree stump] that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest [the chicken-squirrel feeds its young] for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra [the chicken-squirrel tries to solve a basic problem], and that it-
I: think what we've got here is some kind of black market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit. [the rest of the doctors, including the ADA head, laugh at him]
UHYUB: dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand. [points at the chicken-squirrel]
WE: all want double desserts today!
U: uh, Chef.
I: told the ADA a thousand times I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.
OKAY: y, Mom. [turns and hops on the bed. Outside, a periscope rises from the van roof and looks around]
WEH: well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do. They lie. Lie right to your face.


I: was just [looks stung, then flashes an angry look at Kyle] I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
BU: but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
MAYBE: you didn't hear me Kyle I said "shit" on television!

SHITTY: Shitty F-g F g, how do you do?
SHITTY: Shitty F-g F g, how do you do?
I: called you a f g. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word "f-g". So piss off, you f-g-shitter! [laughs and walks away]
SHITTY: Shitty F-g F g, ba doop a doop doo [walks past Stan and Cartman. Cartman is sucking on a Popsicle]
I: am not full of meecro what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
SIR: I'd just like to take this opportunity And, I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say, you are the most creative genius in Hollywood, and... well... I'd let you have me if you wanted.
BUT: I think back in those days it meant something else the plague!
HOW: could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass chanting the word of wretchedness?!
LOOK: at this The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil Geldon [the page he reads from show a dragon], who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed.
ON: the set of the Drew Carey show. The terror continues the knights fight the geldon valiantly.
WE'RE: all saying the S word too much! [Ike hops in]
HOLY: shi [quickly taps his mouth with his hands and releases] poop.


BUTTERS: An all new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
BUTTERS: It's a coupon for a brand new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
TUONG: Lu Kim Where is this Japanese uh toiret bowl?! How far from my Shitty Wok?!
BUTTERS: Wuh you mean the sha sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.

TUONG: Lu Kim Herro o.


BUTTERS: I don't know. I it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. [turns around and looks at them. The other boys look as well. Nearby, the girls chat among themselves, notice the boys, then laugh. Bebe holds up a notebook]
CARTMAN: Kenny face it Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
CARTMAN: [blows a strong raspberry back and flips her off] Fuck you, Bebe! Fuck it, bitch!
CLYDE'S: house. He's looking at himself in a full length mirror in nothing but briefs.
BIG: Eared Boy I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.
BIG: Eared Boy Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!
TRUE: Value Hardware and Home Improvement, day. Someone is purchasing a lot of kerosene, propane, and lighter fluid.
JERRY: Do you like to put this on your True Value card today?
KYLE: I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.


"...ARTICLE: 36 Section 19 One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make..."
I: called you an ass sucker!
LAST: I'd like to bring up my expert witness Sexual Harassment Panda.
PAN: Panda's mouth.
BROFLOVSKI: residence. It is literally bigger now 50% taller, wider, deeper... Same with the garage, itself bigger than the house to it's right. The icicles are also bigger. Furniture movers come by with new furnishings for the new, big house. Two delivery men take a big-screen TV into the house
UH...: S Sexual Harassment Panda.
THAT'S: thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty four hours.
SPECIAL: Report Sexual Harassment
SO: I'll drive this ol' 18 wheeler down the highway...
SK: heeter, I don't want no trouble nu-how.
NU: how, Skeeter. She ain't hurtin' nobody.
YOU'RE-YOU'RE: a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool.
LISTEN: to me when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you. [The courtroom is silent, listening] There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. [reactions are seen in the faces of various people in the courtroom, even in Gerald's face.]


NURSE: 2 Twelve thirty, Eric. Lunch time. [the officers are amazed at how timely the nurse came with the lunch]
I'M: a psychic and you are worse. I have super awesome powers and you don't.
YATES: While the ice cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed.
JIM: Brown-ish The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help.
LIANE: O-o-o-o oh! [prostrates herself]
FEMALE: psychic We brought a class action lawsuit against you! We'll see you before the judge tomorrow! [the psychics turn and walk out]
JIM: Brown ish Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying. [footage of the arrests is shown. Two of them are beaten, a third is slammed against a squad car until the side of her head begins to bleed, and a fourth holds police at bay. He tries to fight them with his powers, but they simply open fire and kill him where he stands] The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective Eric Cartman, [shown in dramatic pose with psychic waves emanating from his forehead] who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence.


O: kay, and how much is that in pubes?
NO: no such thing?
JUST...: get down on your knees and beg me for the money.
WHAT: What are you doing?? [the bills light up and burn from one end to the other. Scott lets the burning bills float away] No!... Wh-why?

MMM: we're environmentalists.
ME: ee!
M: whoa, I'm scared.
MM: good night.

F: minus? Can he do that?
BU: but we're not making it up, it was--
YES: now we're about to roll the film but remember if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.
W: well, let's see if the audience has any questions.
HER: no good husband! She's got to lose that zero and get herself a hero!
BUT: -
RED: haired woman
RED: haired woman
UUH: I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.
WHA: what are you talking about?

CLOSE: up. Ned's hair stands on end.
JESUS: and Pals after a commercial break. Today's topic Tots in Trouble.
O: okay, okay, that's enough.
W: we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble.
W: wait, everybody. Come back.
W: we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.


RANDY: We , I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...

JOSEPH: Smith But he's talking from the U Haul?
MOSES: Um... would there be windows on the U Haul?
CARTMAN: You're a no-good swindler and a too good thief. We were here for money, not goo!
CARTMAN: Aw- Jee . They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
ZOOMS: around Mecha Streisand, showing her from every angle
MECHA: Streisand opens up her eyes, the Diamond on her forehead lights up, and her claws and arm saw are flexed. The gates open and she steps out to meet the celebrities. The song Barbra, Barbra is played. She kneels down and lets out a screech.


HEHEH.: heh, that thing's funny.
MM: it's amazing.
PLEASE: help me. Whoa-oh-oh oh. [falls on his face and gets up] Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick.

O: kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history. [starts writing on the board] Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972? [a jakovasaur kid in the front row raises his hand and waves it] Yes?

BUTTERS: You think I'm ugly ehehee...
STAN: Ho Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
BUTTERS: Can I just have some Spaghetti O's?


CARTMAN: of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
KINDERGARTNERS: a socialist dunghole...
CARTMAN: I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why [writes Y on the board], we're gonna transform into something.
WENDY: Try to understand this all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
CASEY: It is time for that slutty Smurf killing bitch to get what's comin' to 'er.
CARTMAN: Theh They can't do that! I'm student body president!

ANNOUNCER: On this episode of Ghost Hunters a little boy in Colorado appears to be haunted by celebrities. [a shot of Ike floating across the screen, with various backdrops behind him] Now the Ghost Hunter team will roll out and get to the bottom of it. It's the gayest show in the fucking world; Ghost Hunters!
STAN: Alright let's see demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...
STAN: Here here here it is possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
LADY: Judge How did ... Look, it doesn't matter. [turns her back to him] I'm just gonna have to give it up.

[Inside, on the sofa, Chris reads the newspaper, Linda reads a book]
TRENT: I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me a 5-second head-start.
CARTMAN: Draw the You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks.
STAN: We're dead. Trent knows we sent the 6th graders after him.
MAN: 6 Just tell us this do you trust that we want what's best for you, yes or no? [no reply]

HEH: I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy. [Rick and Susan pop into the campers' cabin.]
ESCAPE: aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave.
SO: let's just all put on our try hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT!
NO: dude check this out It's a video this kid, he does all kinds of crazy stuff. [pops the video into the VCR and turns on the TV] Check it out!

THERE'S: a brand new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."
ALL: the horrible food we eat the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.
ALL: natural cell phones! [Two stoners, who appear to be Richard 'Cheech' Marin and Tommy Chong, appear at the door with boxes of stuff]
GOOD: bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you.
SWITCH: to live action. Daytime in a middle class American backyard. A dyed sandy-haired, middle-aged, white woman speaks with her sandy-haired daughter while seated on the patio lounge.
HIPPIES.: Hi-i ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! [Stan rises from the other side of the bed with the medical book, and Butters rises, too]
HU: uh?!
BOYS: I have an announcement to make I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. [hands the book to Kyle, who looks at it]

B: huh, huh. Yeah, right.
KENNY: enters the "Grab-O Lux"

IT...LOOKS: like he got a... a-a can of string beans. Hehe.
WHAT: the ?!
HE: rubs up against them lovingly. He sees a large screen TV and a potted plant, and walks towards them. He then looks to his right and sees Sally Struthers feasting on some cake and two Ethiopians fanning her with palm fronds. She sees him and stops eating. Cartman is mad.
AS: horrible as they were theh they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-
WE'RE: terribly sorry about the mix up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately.


CARTMAN: Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!

GERALD: Uh Tolkien this is very important do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?

JIMMY: N-n no, you retards! The video s...tore!
KYLE: Middle earth is again safe.
STAN: oh.
RANDY: A alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths. [the boys are stunned] Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal.


OKAY: dude it's 3 30. [Cartman changes the channel]
BUT: I warn You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.

O: villany Ho let the door be lock'd Treachery! Seek it out.
IT: is here Hamlet Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
NEVER: believe it I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih.

THAT'S: what I was gonna say You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault. [awkward pause] But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. [now dejected]


CARTMAN: hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
BUTTERS: A organized pantry.
PETE: More preppy straight A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
BUTTERS: Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M by my dad, by kids at school.
PRINCIPAL_VICTORIA: but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. [the door opens behind the Goths]
PETE: Let's just face it they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. [they all look at each other thoughtfully]
WHILE: the song is playing the following happens Michael is the first to torch some clothes. Henrietta follows with the belts and scarves. Pete begins to torch the jewelry


MR.: Garrison Right [stops in his tracks at the door's entrance, his smile turns to wonder. He turns around] Wha- ...what was that?
MR.: Garrison Yeh you don't say. [strokes his chin] Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria. [walks out and closes the door] Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay!
STAN: N no?
MR.: Garrison damnit!
MR.: Garrison [stops and thinks] Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave. [paces a bit] The parents have to see for themselves. [snaps his fingers] The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!
MR.: Slave I've got a little Oof. [grabs his stomach] Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?
MAN: 6 But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le rant.
LEMMI-: Lemmi- Lemmiwinks. Le Lemmiwiiinks.

SOUTH: Park Elementary. The school bell rings. Most of the third grade boys are in a shop room.
NOW: let me make one thing crystal clear I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a- [picks up a picture of a woman and begins to get lost looking at it] I have... uh, I have a...
RI: chard! [he whistles] Ri-chard! [he remembers mumbling something in return, and pulls out her picture. He dreams: she is back on the swing] Swing me Richard, swing me higher![now in a gazebo] Richard, I'm here! [waves him over. Cut to her opening a little box] Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! [in the cockpit, she calls out] It's all for you! [an alarm sounds, and the gas tank explodes behind her] Aaaaaaa! [she tries to land the plane right, but it falls into a swimming pool. She's thrown clear, into the water] Richard!
I: don't think that's very fair if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
REMEMBER: Tweek punch hard, punch low.
NOW: LISTEN to me Hurlong kashurshar All right And seriously Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
TWEEK: lands some punches and Craig tries to throw Tweek off sumo style. They go back and forth this way for a while
TO: whom it may concern I can no longer live without her. I couldn't say goodbye to her, and so now I must say goodbye to all of you, for I am all out of nicotine gum.Sincerely yours,
GOOD: bye, cruel world. [sits up] Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell! [lie back down, now head first]
YE: hah!
TO: Stan ] We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
BUT: I can't. I never got a chance to say good bye.
GOOD: bye?
OF: course you don't. Saying good bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it.


MR.: Mackey Huh... e excuse me a minute, Stan. m'kay? [stands up, goes to his desk, picks up his phone and starts dialing] Uh, hi, Ms. Bronski? Did we vaccinate Stan for the flu last year? We did? Uh oh... I think he's got Asperger's.
CARTMAN: I I'll try. I'll try. [lays on his stomach. The nurse sees something under his pants and pulls them back.]
MORPHEUS: Try and focus Stan we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now.
CARTMAN: The Zookeeper 2 Zookeepier! [they walk back out and away.]

CARTMAN: goes to a clothing store looking for ill fitting clothes. He then cobbles a custom shoe for himself. He goes home and tries it out. He goes to a CGI studio and puts on a motion suit so he can make a 3D model of himself on a computer. He takes the 3D model home and modifies it on his own computer: "Handicapped Walk Analysis." He then goes into the bathroom and cuts off clumps of his hair to look as if he were retarded. He goes to the living room and looks at a Kid Rock video for more inspiration and takes notes. He puts on a bicycle helmet and pulls his hair out through the holes. He assembles the various parts of his handicapped outfit and puts it on. He squishes his face upwards for the finishing touch and ties the helmet straps together well below his chin.
JIMMY: N no, Dad.
LIANE: Oh... N no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.

"TO: PLEDGE CALL 1-800-555-2717"] You know, Susan, the uh-there are so many great missionaries doing work, out there in in in-in parts of Africa, and uh we're trying to get Bibles to people all over the world. And what we need, is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects. Now, listen to this, Susan. [a picture of Hollis with two Ethiopians appears over his right shoulder] Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it.
YEAH.: We're not sure what these hyper intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ.

WE'RE: trying to find the brown noise it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
NUH: uh!
AAAAAAH: apparently he's seen a sign that reads "Arkansas 410 miles. Rest Stop 5 miles"] Huhh, ohh, [the students and Mr. Mackey look back.]
M'KAY: Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?
M'KAY: I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
WHY: would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary school psychologist?!
YUH: NO! [panting, dirty and black-eyed, gets up and places Mr. Hat between Mr. Garrison's arms] You may have won this time, Mr. Hat.

BUTTERS: "Makes your calves stronger in just 2 days!"
RANCHER: Bob I followed a calf curling trail right to your house, ma'am.
STAN: Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for 3, perhaps even 4 weeks. So, if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
BUTTERS: Hey y-yeah. W-w we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
FIELD: reporter Tom it looks like I have an update Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to "Puppies from Around the World."
STAN: O ogh...
GLEN: Dumont Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico.
STAN: Well I guess we learned something today it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.

RANDY: Hey Stanley you need to understand something Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?!

THIS: episode begins with an expanded montage of last week's time lapse imagery. First you see the town, the mall, and a house. Next, Cartman and the Wii at EV Games. Next, scenes from his night of insomnia, including him checking his calendar and the Wii's Web page, then watching TV. Then, Eric is shown begging his friends to help him freeze himself. Then, a collage of Eric hiding in the freezer, talking to Butters, and walking to the designated spot with him. Then, scenes of the avalanche and Eric getting frozen. Then the years begin to roll, and scenes of humanity's future appear. They are: the scene of the avalanche, a scene of devastation, the room where Cartman is taken to be thawed, his meeting with the high UAL command, the UAL building being attacked, a shot of Earth from space, the UAA storming in to fight the UAL, the battle between the two factions, the UAA closing in on Cartman, the voyage away from the UAL building, across a desert; the onscreen communication with the AAA, a shot of Earth's future, a sea otter blowing into the nafferty, and the final shot of two ships leading the camera to the city the UAL is based at

WUH: okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject.
STILL: later 10:08p.m.. The boys are hyperactive.
10: 15 p.m. gives way to 3:26 a.m., which finds the boys sitting against the bed. Tweek is on it, and Cartman is passed out next to the toys, surrounded by pools of vomit. Kenny looks sleepy.

SHARON: Yes. Wall Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
WALL: Mart, midnight. Randy enters dressed in pajamas and robe, only to find more shoppers in there. Wall-Mart never closes, and it's never empty. An elderly lady greets him.
ELDERLY: Woman Thanks for coming to Wall Mart. [waves] All are welcome. All are welcome! [Randy is stunned that he's not the only shopper there]
MR.: Farkle I can't compete with Wall Mart's low prices. Everyone is shopping there now, and... well, I can't make ends meet. [Cartman pulls out a violin from somewhere and begins playing it masterfully] I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work.
CARTMAN: ... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall Mart. It was only 5 bucks. [flips Kyle off, turns around, and walks away. Kyle watches him leave]
STAN: But your face!
WALL: Mart, later. Shopping continues as usual. In his office, the Manager nervously reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle of liquor. He takes two sips and quickly hides it when he hears a knock at his door.
KYLE: But you run the Wall Mart.
KYLE: You hate Wall Mart, too? [rumbles emanate from the walls]
WALL: Mart, night. The Marsh family arrives and sees what Randy saw before.
GERALD: Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at 9 30 at night?
OUTSIDE.: The boys walk away from Wall Mart and see a driver lifting I-beams into place with his crane.
KYLE: But nobody wants a Wall Mart here!
DRIVER: You're gonna have to talk to the higher ups.
CARTMAN: Nuh uh.
KYLE: You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall Mart!
KYLE: He is working for the Wall Mart to stop us from succeeding!
KYLE: Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall Mart in our town.
HARVEY: Brown We... invented the Wall Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low. [defeated, buries his face in his left hand] We didn't know what we were doing. In just 4 years, it was out of control.
KYLE: The heart of Wall Mart?
HARVEY: Brown Every Wall Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!
HARVEY: Brown Because the Wall Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall-Mart and now. They are Wall-Mart shoppers all.
MARVIN: Marsh Welcome to Wall Mart.
WALL: Mart Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far. [the boys approach him]
WALL-MART: I am... Wall Mart. [the boys look at each other]
WALL: Mart I've taken this form in order to talk to you. But I can take many forms. [dons a brimmed hat] Does this suit you better? Or perhaps you prefer this form? [takes off the hat and puts on a robe] I can take whichever form I like. [removes the robe and puts on a pirate hat and black patch over his left eye.]
WALL-MART: To find the heart of Wall Mart, one must first ask oneself, "Who is it that asked the question?" [the boys look at each other again]
WALL: Mart Ah, yes, but who are you?
WALL: Mart Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!
WALL-MART: Very well. You want to see the heart of Wall Mart? It lies beyond that plasma-screen television. [the boys look to their right and walk over. The open a small door marked "EMPLOYEES ONLY" and they open it. A rectangular mirror is behind it.]
WALL: Mart Yes, don't you see? That is the heart of Wall-Mart. You, the consumer. I take many forms: Wall-Mart, K-Mart, Target. But I am one single entity: Desire!
WALL: Mart Gaaah! No! No, what have you done?! [the building begins to rumble] Now you shall see my true form! [Removes his mustache and begins to march around with vigor and laughing harshly] Now you see me as I truly am!
KYLE: The Wall Mart is imploding! Everybody out NOW! [the shoppers and employees now bolt for the doors and run out as an M in Mart falls down.]
KYLE: All Wall-Marts start a self destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.


SHARON: I can't believe you said the N word on national television!
RANDY: I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. [The camera shows Jesse Jackson behind a desk, with three officials around him]
RANDY: Y Yes, absolutely.
INSIDE: the club an African American is doing his routine
PASSENGER: He done said the N word in the O.J. case.
RANDY: You said the N word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
CARTMAN: gets Mr. Nelson ...in a half Nelson, then picks him up, carries him around 360 degrees, then throws him off. Mr. Nelson gets under Cartman to pick him up and throw him over his back, but ends up just tickling Cartman, and Cartman laughs.
RANDY: Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
MR.: Nelson Ung cle!


KYLE: Better than being a fat ass Texan!

DAWSON: One UPS vehicle valued at twenty five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle worth sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixty thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass!
DAWSON: One more slip up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers!
CARTMAN: Awwwwrrr auugh. [hangs up his coat and holster on the coat tree in the living room]
BUTTERS: Who-o-o-o a. Oowwww!


SHEILA: That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth that originally I'm from Jersey. [the adults present are Stephen and Linda Stotch, Randy and Sharon Marsh, Stuart McCormick, his wife, and Liane Cartman] Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang. [a picture of her is shown] I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face. [a picture of one such incident is shown] Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey. [turns away from the other adults] I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
P: Train What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago.

They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. [Cartman begins a slow clap, then speeds it up. The techs in the room join in and soon everyone is applauding Kyle's speech]
CARTMAN: O hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! [the imaginary Cartman is a little shocked]
CARTMAN: O hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
CARTMAN: No Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.

KYLE: Listen this is all you need to the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit cards to practically anyone who applies for them. [pulls out an envelope] I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card. [from Kyle's position, one can see hundreds of people listening to him] It has no spending limit. [cries of shock rise from the crowd] Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
MAN: 12 Well then there's only one option we have to kill the Jew.
SHEILA: No o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life! [stands up and walks away] Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! [Randy gets an idea, points towards his house, and leaves.

BUTTERS: Wuh ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like, [sobs] it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. [Stan blinks, clearly affected by the speech] And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So, I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...

[writes "NO SEX" on the board] There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world. [faces the class] Now, this would be fine except that in the Muslim religion you also can't... Anybody? [no response] Jack off. [writes "NO JACKING OFF" on the board] Okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion. [faces the class] And what do we know about the places Muslims live? They live in? [no response] Good, sand. [writes "SAND" on the board] Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too!
MR.: Mackey Attention students Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!
SNN: special report. A graphic about "FOX CENSORED" is over the reporter's left shoulder
MRS.: Garrison Why would they ?
AL: Zawahri [translated] Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!!
CARTMAN: Because they made f fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
ANNOUNCER: Next week on South Park The race continues. Cartman reaches the Family Guy Studio and learns the shocking secret behind the Family Guy writing staff.

EXECUTIVE: Twenty five minutes.
KYLE: Listen to me the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
PETER: Or the time I [click. SNN shows up onscreen]
AL: Zawahri [translated] We warned you not to show Mohammad- But "Family Guy" did it anyways. So now, here is our retaliation on America!!!
