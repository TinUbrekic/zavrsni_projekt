SAT: on marshmallow desks with teddy bear smiles
HUH: it sure was.
WHEN: it comes to time traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-
TIME: travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back.

RANDY: Whoa-ho-ho ooh, what happened? Is it over?


ANCHOR: The tornado was said to be the deadliest in fifty six years. In other news, it's been twenty-four hours now and the Princess of Canada is still missing. All of Canada is in mourning as nationwide suicides abound. [a shot of a small skyscraper. People in it begin jumping out of its windows to their deaths]
GEDDY: Lee And it seems to me you lived your life like a flower breaking wind. [farts. Members of the crowd begin killing themselves] Never knowing whom to count on... [Alex Lifeson shoots himself in the head. The singer breaks down and cries]
ANCHOR: the Prince of Canada has said that-... ... Uh, we have just received breaking news that the Canadian government now knows who took the princess. The Canadian Prime Ministries instructing all people of Canadian descent to go home and... open their box of faith. [softly] Box of faith? What the fuck is that? [Ike understands and runs home. He goes into his room and to his closet. He tosses out as many toys as needed until he finds the box, then pulls it out into the room. He blows the dust off and reads the lid: "Open ONLY if instructed by the Prime Minister of Canada." He messes with the box until it pops open and a small projector pops out]
SCOTT: You fart loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
SCOTT: Fart loving Eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!

[an atomic bomb is detonated] Women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated. [footage of bomb victims appears] Those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. Burns, radiation poisoning. For generations the radiation affected the victims. Japanese babies born without rimbs. Without eyes! [Cartman snickers. The emperor turns, folds his arms over his chest, and glares at him]
EMPEROR: Akihito Chicken and a cow? Chicken and-a cow?!
HATOYAMA: Chicken and cow use poor dohfin and weiru as a scapegoat?! This is outrage! [pounds his desk]

KYLE: damnit!


CARTMAN: Uh th that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
MRS.: Garrison Y yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken.
CARTMAN: And this is exactly what Kenny would do stand here and say nothing! [Kenny makes an angry face]

JIMMY: W What are you talking about, Eric?
RANDY: I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at 4 00, you got it?
PI: Pi Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi-Pi. How can I help you?
ASSISTANT: Pi Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park.
PI: Pi Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?
ASSISTANT: Pi Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is 83%. [with some urgency] You have to shut down.
PI: Pi What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggest-a weekend. Everyone is having a-theh fun.
PI: Pi Gehntlemen, please-a. I come-a from ada Venice. [shows off a real life picture of a canal in Venice] Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee.
BUTTERS: Oh b hoy, the waves are starting up again!
JIMMY: W What's that? [Explosions of pee come out of every ride, overrunning them all. A huge pee wave rises over the park and swamps it, destroying every structure. An unlucky slider is swept down in a rush of pee. A woman loses her baby as the wave strikes her back. The pee tsunami sweeps across the Mt. Everest attraction. A statue of a man scaling the mountain falls off]
PI: Pi [holding on to the sign post] Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee! [the signpost breaks off and both man and post are swept away by the pee. Stan, Butters, and Jimmy climb up the Mr. Everest sign]
FIRE: Marshal So this is all pee related?
BACK: in the pee filled water park, Jimmy, Butters, and Stan stand on the Mt. Everest attraction. Kyle is on what remains of the Drop Zone!! sign, but it moves a little, sinking a bit.
CARTMAN: Haa aa. Yes, thank you.
PI: Pi Why? Why didn't Pi-Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi-Pi, but-a the Pi-Pi not-a belieeve them. [sobs some more. The boys approach him]
PI: Pi [stands up and faces them] Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a 90% pee.
PI-PI: But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi-Pi. In a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open it, all this pee can be lowered.
JIMMY: Okay. W where's the maintenance room?
PI-PI: That is a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi-Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? [Stan, Butters and Jimmy all look at Kyle, who looks back at them]
PI: Pi [grabs Kyle by the left wrist and pulls him away from his friends] Please-a you have to hurry! [lets go] I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower.
PI-PI: Boys-a please a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!
PI: Pi Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi-Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.
PI-PI: You've got-a the map and-a Pi Pi's instructions?
PI-PI: Good a. Now just one last thing. [takes a glass jar sitting next to him and scoops some pee into it] You need to drink-a some pee.
PI-PI: You just need to drink about a three cups of pee.
PI-PI: You swim a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate.
PI-PI: But only you can hold a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!
PI-PI: What's a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!
PI: Pi Sure you will, you drank only pee for 9 months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.
PI-PI: There's no more time-a. You have to drink a the pee NOW! [Kyle begins to drink it, then stops]
PI: Pi Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.
KYLE: Aaahh. [gulps down the rest of the glass and throws the glass away] AAAAH! [the glass breaks on a boulder off screen]
PI: Pi All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a- [some helicopters are heard approaching]

MEN'S: er, Boys' Room, later. The police are in there with Mr. Mackey. Police tape has been placed around the urinal
JOE: F really?
KYLE: Yes. I'm saying one fourth of Americans are retards.
KYLE: Let's take a test sample There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
CARTMAN: So now the inevitable question if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? [he begins to use his fingers to show the numbers as he says them] Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. [click. Kyle now appears superimposed on the 9/11 picture already onscreen]. Kyle!
POLICE: headquarters. Det. Yates has a post 9/11 picture with a circled question mark where the towers used to be.
JOE: Oh F , oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.
KYLE: Eh xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.
BUSH: We are all-knowing and all-powerful. Good bye, boys. [steps aside as Dick Cheney takes aim at them. Cheney fires an arrow at them, but the arrow hits a marble vase on a table behind the boys. The arrow bounces off the vase and hits fire alarm, which sets off the sprinkler system. Everyone does his best not to get wet]
KYLE: You f figured this thing all out?
BEARDED: man Not me. My mystery solving sons. Come on in, boys. [the Hardly Boys enter] My boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd, which gave them a clue.
MR.: Hardly Just one thing Mr. President How the devil did you know we were all here? [a close-up of Kyle. A gun appears next to his left temple. The camera moves clockwise as it refocuses on Stan, who's got the gun aimed at Kyle. Stan must have told the President]
KYLE: So wait wait Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?


STAN: Relationship stat I didn't even pay any attention to that-
CARTMAN: huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
KYLE: Oh n no, I'm not really friends with him.
STAN: oh...


KYLE: Wait wait it it's Stan's birthday.

STAN: S hold it a while, okay?
STAN: No dude, I told you I can't do that.
STAN: S so then we win?


AS: the song is sung the show's logo appears "The Catholic Boat." A pink anchor rises and ushers in the next scene: A happy Father Michaels stroking his chin. A second anchor, and Young Boy #1 (Butters) is shown. A third anchor and Father Williams appears. He pulls his shirt up to expose his chest. The fourth anchor, and Young Boy #2 (Tweek) is shown. The fifth anchor, and three priests, Fathers Abraham, Duncan, and Ortiz, are shown partying. Father Abraham falls over laughing. Father Duncan grabs Father Ortiz behind the head and pushes the head down... The sixth anchor, and Young Boy #3 (Stan) is shown. A priest's arm appears, running the index finger all over Stan's face...
STAN: We don't know. We're that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
CHEF: Good bah! [leaves quickly]
CARTMAN: What that's not dumb. Think about it food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
PRIEST: Maxi yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion.
ELDERLY: priest Hih it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all priests here; the doors are closed.

They begin to sway and chant, and the windows above brighten as beams of light flood in]
CARTMAN: O hoo, what's that, Kyle?

SNACKY: S'mores presents The Miracle of Child Birth. [shot of the girls watching] The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking.
LOOK: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know, [pan to a shot of Mr. Mackey looking down] someone who has a bad opinion of it, [pan to a shot of Ms. Choksondik nodding in agreement] or even a complete pervert. [pan to a shot of Mr. Garrison]
THEN: it's decided no more condom classes in grade school.
